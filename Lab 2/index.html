                <p>
                    Hi there, I'm Emily! I've been making webpages for fun since I was a kid. I spent too much time on Neopets growing up, but fortunately it introduced me to coding. My favourite pastime on there was making a bunch of webpage templates for people to use on their Neopets profiles. Since I was only 11 when I started this... I didn't know how to code from scratch! So, a lot of my beginner pages were Frankensteins of college student's code that I edited. Thankfully, now I'm the college student and I do know how to code from scratch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I stopped making webpages around 13 years old, because I got super into illustration instead. I honed that craft until I went off to university and studied cognitive science--a subject all about the brain and AI. Fast forward to now, and I'm here at Georgian to combine all of my interests into one! With my expansive background in design related subjects and my university degree about the mind and programming, I get to stir it all together into this lovely computer programming program.
